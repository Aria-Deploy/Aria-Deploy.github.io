              <h2>1. Introduction & Use Case</h2>
              <p>Canary deployment is a technique that allows revisions of an application or service, referred to as the
                canary, to be analyzed using a subset of the real network traffic. This deployment technique minimizes
                potential errors and risks for the majority of users by targeting a minority of the user base. (Çeliku
                1) Canary deployments are sophisticated, require considerable configuration, and can be time consuming
                to both implement and analyze.</p>
              <p>Aria is a tool which allows users to simplify the creation, configuration, and analysis of canary
                deployments. Aria automates much of the onerous infrastructure management while providing the user with
                the safety and data analysis benefits of canary deploys. Thus, Aria allows the user to focus on
                configuration which meaningfully impacts analysis of changes to production software.</p>

                <h3>1.1 Hypothetical</h3>
                <p>To better understand the use case for Aria, consider ChartHealth – a hypothetical company that
                  provides an electronic medical record software. ChartHealth’s product manages sensitive patient
                  information with a user base spanning hundreds of health care facilities nationally. The ChartHealth
                  product includes features such as: reading/writing to electronic medical records (EMR), aggregation of
                  patient statistics, and data science models used to identify trends across EMRs.</p>

                  alt="Screenshot showing ChartHealth's homepage.">
                <p>Recently, ChartHeath has expanded its business to include facilities in most US states spanning from
                  Hawaii to Maine. Additionally, ChartHealth’s software product has grown in complexity due to feature
                  additions as demanded by customers and evolving regulations. These additions have resulted in a rapid
                  growth of both the number of developers employed by the company and size of the product codebase. As a
                  result of expansion to facilities across five time zones, ChartHealth’s product must now have
                  practically zero downtime in order to not lose business to competitors offering similar products.</p>

                  alt="Diagram showing ChartHealth's migration from monolith to microservices architecture.">
                <p>In order to meet these new challenges, ChartHealth has decided to migrate their current on-site
                  monolith architecture to a cloud-based microservice architecture. As a result of the planned
                  migration, the company’s monolithic product codebase has been split into multiple services owned and
                  operated by different teams of developers.</p>

                <h3>1.2 The Problem with Traditional Deployments</h3>
                <div class="text-animation">
                  <p>When deploying a new revision of software to the monolithic architecture, ChartHealth utilized a
                    traditional ‘big-bang’ software deployment technique. Big-bang software deployments update whole or
                    large parts of an application in one operation. The inherent downsides to big-bang deployments
                    include: exposure of all users to issues due to software changes, longer delays between deployments,
                    extensive testing of the entire codebase per deployment. (Skowronski et al.). ChartHealth was able
                    to manage these downsides prior to the recent expansion, when it’s smaller developer team could more
                    easily manage and comprehend the entire codebase.</p>

                    <source src="./images/aria_visuals/videos/traditional_deployment.mp4">
                  </video>
                </div>
                <p>In the context of ChartHealth’s planned service-based architecture, there are multiple reasons that
                  the ‘big-bang’ approach is no longer appropriate. First, for example, the EMR management feature must
                  be as high-integrity as possible to satisfy government regulations. Simply replacing the EMR service
                  for all users in one ‘big-bang’ presents unreasonable risk which may result in inaccurate records
                  capture or deletion. Second, even on a service-by-service basis, if issues with new revisions of a
                  service are encountered, rolling back production to previous revisions of the service will likely
                  result in undesired downtime (Skowronski et al).</p>
                <p>With the understanding that their deployment technique must change, ChartHealth’s technical
                  leadership undertakes a review of the modern deployment techniques and finds a plethora of options.

              <h2>2. Modern Deployments</h2>
              <p>In the context of microservice architectures, the goal of modern deployment practices is to achieve
                small and frequent service revision releases which result in zero downtime. While each of the many
                unique deployment techniques share this characteristic, the approaches can be distinguished by their
                tradeoffs.</p>
              <p>With the understanding that a modern deployment strategy must be employed to facilitate deployment of
                revisions on a service-by-service basis, ChartHealth begins exploring the landscape of modern
                deployments. The company specifically seeks to understand which of the deployment types are most
                commonly employed. ChartHealth contacts multiple companies which provide deployment solution products
                and requests usage data from those suppliers.</p>

                the four most common deployment techniques between the customer bases of both companies are: big bang,
                rolling, blue/green, and canary.</p>

                <p>Rolling deployments introduce service revisions by incrementally replacing the current production
                  service code on each of multiple nodes within the architecture. This type of deployment is only
                  applicable if there are multiple instances of the same service operating in production. An
                  interesting, and perhaps desirable, aspect of rolling deployments is that the current production and
                  new revision of a service can coexist simultaneously for extended time periods (Çeliku 12). Rolling
                  deployments can also target specific user groups according to region, IP address, and a variety of
                  other traffic differentiators.</p>

                  <p>Blue/green deployments require two environments: blue and green. The first environment, green
                    within the above diagram, is the current production environment. The second blue environment is an
                    almost exact replica of the green (production) environment. The only difference between their
                    content is the revision of the target service.</p>

                </div>
                <p>After the newly introduced blue domain has completed initialization, a network switch or load
                  balancer routes 100% of the incoming network traffic to either blue or green environments exclusively.
                  As the deployment progresses, the traffic router redirects traffic to and from the blue or green
                  domains on an as needed basis. At any point in time, only one of the deployments is processing
                  incoming network traffic. The traffic router can maintain routing to the blue environment if the
                  service revision performance is acceptable. At this point, the blue environment effectively achieves
                  production status and the ‘older’ green domain can be destroyed. (Fowler)</p>

                <div class="text-animation">
                  <p>This technique involves introducing a revised instance of a service, referred to as the canary,
                    into the same production environment as the current production version of the service. A load
                    balancer routes a minority of the incoming network traffic to be served by the canary instance.
                    During the canary deployment, a majority of the network traffic continues to be served by the
                    production service. The instance is continually analyzed such that any newly introduced issues can
                    be detected without impacting the majority of the user base (Çeliku 13). A small amount of incoming
                    network traffic is directed to the canary instance initially, data on its performance is collected
                    and analyzed, and the amount of traffic diverted may be increased or decreased based on the analysis
                    (Sato).</p>

              <h2>3. Choosing the Right Deployment Strategy</h2>
              <p>First and foremost, a deployment strategy should both align with and serve business goals. For example,
                a
                service owner may prioritize zero downtime when rolling out service updates because customers require
                access to medical information regardless of the time of day. Some of the other considerations may
                include;
                cost, engineering skill set, available testing tools, potential schema changes, and others. (Google SRE)
              </p>
              <p>Upon reviewing the above described deployment methods, disagreement arose between the ChartHealth
                developer teams. The team responsible for the Stats service favored the Big Bang approach. The team
                responsible for the Trends service felt that Blue/Green deployments were more suitable for the
                development
                and release cadence of their service. The medical records team, chiefly concerned with data integrity,
                rejected all deployment types except canary deployment.</p>
              <p>[INSERT THREE SERVICES PER DEPLOYMENT TYPE IMAGE]</p>
              <p>A major benefit of adopting a microservices architecture is the decoupling that can be achieved between
                services. Decoupling between services can be expressed in terms of how the service is developed,
                implemented, and deployed independent of one another (Indrasiri). Thus, although each of the ChartHealth
                development teams disagree on which deployment technique to utilize, each can be satisfied by adopting
                the
                deployment technique of their choosing.</p>
              <p>Upon reviewing common modern deployments, the ChartHealth EMR service development team elected to adopt
                canary deployments. The deciding factor was that medical record data integrity is paramount. The
                development team is first and foremost concerned about minimizing risk of issues being presented by new
                service revisions which could result in incorrect or missing patient medical data.</p>

                <h3 id="three.one">3.1 Canary Analysis</h3>
                <p>The most encompassing definition of canary deployment may be:</p>
                <blockquote>deployment which consists of gradually shifting the network traffic [within the production
                  environment] from the old application version to the new application version (Çeliku 13)</blockquote>
                <p>This language is very broad but may be the only definition which satisfies the myriad implementations
                  across companies. Some organizations implement simplistic deployments which are little more than
                  automated traffic splitters (Mitreski). Others divide HTTP traffic such that individual user sessions
                  are handled by the canary or production service revision exclusively (Tucker). Some implementations
                  combine canary release with other deployment techniques such as Blue/Green (Ehmke).</p>
                <p>While there are many axes over which canary deployments can be divided, there are two groupings based
                  on historical progression of the technique (Çeliku 2) (CD Foundation). While no formal terminology
                  exists for this variation in canary analysis techniques, these implementations can be referred to as
                  manual canary analysis and automated canary analysis.</p>
                <div class="inner">
                  <h4 id="three.one.one">3.1.1 Manual Analysis</h4>
                  <object style="width: 100%;" data="./images/aria_visuals/svgs/Manual_Analysis.svg"
                    type="image/svg+xml"></object>
                  <p>From inception, canary deployment required human intervention at one or more stages of the process.
                    This manual approach required engineer review of data representing the health of the deployment. In
                    order to achieve this ‘manual analysis’ approach, tools which summarize canary performance metrics
                    and/or event logs for human consumption are required. After review, the engineer determines whether
                    to
                    continue or halt the canary deployment. Considering this approach as manual canary analysis, the
                    method was the only available until recently.</p>
                  <h4 id="three.one.two">3.1.2 Automated Analysis</h4>
                  <p>Eventually, statistical techniques improved such that continuous delivery of canary deployments
                    could
                    be achieved without human intervention (Graff). While automation of manual canary analysis had
                    simply
                    been a matter of implementation, the statistical techniques had lacked the fidelity to properly
                    determine if a canary deployment was operating at a tolerable level of risk.</p>
                  <object style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: 1rem;"
                    data="./images/aria_visuals/svgs/Automated_Analysis.svg" type="image/svg+xml"></object>
                  <p>Automated canary analysis utilizes an automated judge. The judge performs statistical analysis of
                    canary performance metrics stored as time-series data. The judge computes an overall score based on
                    a
                    comparison of the metric data against specified priorities, weights, and thresholds. The overall
                    score
                    is then compared against a predefined threshold to determine if the canary instance is fit to
                    replace
                    the current service revision. The upside of automated canary analysis is a fully automated delivery
                    pipeline.</p>
                  <p>However, the ChartHealth EMR service developer team recognizes that automated canary analysis
                    requires a high-degree of trust in the automated system. Given that their priority is focused on
                    complete fidelity of medical records management, the developer team elects not to utilize automated
                    canary analysis. However, the team is wants to leverage the advanced statistical techniques utilized
                    by automated canary analysis to more precisely understand the performance impacts of new revisions
                    (Vamp).</p>

                <h2 id="three.two">3.2 Survey of Existing Solutions</h2>
                <p>Armed with a more detailed understanding of the type of canary deployment it is seeking, ChartHealth
                  then takes inventory of the products and open source solutions which facilitate canary deployments.
                </p>
                <object style="width: 100%;" data="./images/aria_visuals/svgs/3ProductCategories.svg"
                  type="image/svg+xml"></object>
                <p>ChartHealth discovers that the existing solutions can be divided into three categories which can be
                  referred to as: platform services, orchestrator plugins, and standalone solutions.</p>
                <p>Platform services are solutions constructed from managed services offered by infrastructure
                  providers.
                  While the infrastructure services provider abstracts away the low level details of infrastructure
                  creation and management, it is the responsibility of the user (in this instance a ChartHealth
                  engineer)
                  to define and manage the infrastructure at a high level. The user composes and deploys the instances
                  which house the canary service(s) and performance observability products. Of the three categories,
                  platform services require ChartHealth’s EMR services developer team to have a DevOps skill set in
                  addition to software engineering. Examples of canary deployments which utilize platform services
                  include
                  implementations by companies such as HolidayCheck (McAllister), and Klarna (Mitreski).
                <p>Orchestrator plugins are another category of solutions. These are third-party plugins such as
                  Serverless, Argo Rollouts, and Kong Canary Release. These plugins are designed to integrate into
                  control-plane orchestration products such as Kubernetes or Istio. The options for tailoring a canary
                  deployments using plugin products are constrained by the limitations of the control plane itself,
                  usually resulting in more primitive canary deployments. ChartHealth immediately recognizes that one of
                  the major limitations of these solutions is the inherent requirement that the control plane product
                  must
                  be utilized as well. Control plane products are high in overhead, especially considering ChartHealth’s
                  microservice architecture is not as complex as the environments that control planes are meant to
                  manage.
                </p>
                <p>The standalone category refers to software-as-a-service (SaaS) or open-source platforms. These
                  products
                  can integrate with control plane orchestrators but can also perform canary deployments independently.
                  Canary releases are not the focus of but rather one of many features offered by these products. Some
                  products, such as those offered by Octopus Deploy and Vamp, are paid-for SaaS solutions. The
                  open-source
                  solution in this category is Spinnaker. Like its SaaS equivalents, Spinnaker is a comprehensive
                  product
                  which offers many more features than canary deployments but requires a significant time investment to
                  setup and maintain. Within this category, Spinnaker and Vamp are unique products in that both offer
                  automated canary analysis.</p>
                <h4 id="three.two.one">3.2.1 Evaluating Exisitng Solutions</h4>
                <p>After surveying available canary deployment solutions, the ChartHeath EMR service developer team has
                  decided that none are quite the right fit for their needs. They are not interested in platform
                  services
                  products because ChartHeath’s software engineering organization lacks DevOps experience. ChartHealth
                  does not stand alone in this regard. A DevOps survey conducted by Atlassian and CITE Research found
                  that
                  46% of companies have 3 years or less of DevOps experience, and that 37% of companies reported that
                  the
                  barrier to DevOps implementation is due to a lack of employee skills (Atlassian). For these reasons,
                  ChartHealth does not believe its engineering staff is currently capable of managing a platform service
                  solution.</p>
                <p>The development team also decided against orchestrator plugin solutions due to the overhead of
                  implementing a control plane product. ChartHealth’s planned three service architecture does not
                  justify
                  a control product more complex than the microservice architecture itself.</p>
                <p>Ideally, the development team would choose to implement Spinnaker in order to further reduce
                  deployment
                  risk by utilizing the Kayenta automated canary analysis package. Spinnaker allows for configuration of
                  canary deployments via a streamlined UI. However, similar to the orchestrator plugin solutions, the
                  standalone solutions are too complex relative to the task of deploying the lone EMR service within a
                  wider architecture.</p>
                <p>While none of the other existing solutions satisfy ChartHealth’s EMR service development team, this
                  use
                  case is precisely that which Aria is meant to address.</p>

                <p>Because the existing third-party solutions don't fit the needs of the ChartHealth engineering team,
                  they have chosen to use Aria, a canary deployment & infrastructure management tool.</p>

                  <section id="section41">
                    <h3 id="four.one">4.1 What is Aria?</h3>
                    <p>Aria is an open-source, self-hosted canary deployment tool that helps developers quickly manage
                      the
                      lifecycle of canary deployments. Aria focuses the user on application specific configuration to
                      achieve a high fidelity automated analysis of the deployment performance.</p>
                    <img style="width: 150%; margin: -12%; margin-left: -40%;"
                      src="./images/aria_visuals/pngs/Infrastructure_Isometric.png" />
                    <p>Each Aria managed deployment is composed of three instances: canary, baseline, and monitor. A
                      specified subset of incoming production traffic is redirected from the production infrastructure
                      to
                      the canary and baseline instances. The monitoring instance contains tooling for both performance
                      metrics and canary specific analysis enabling side-by-side comparison of the current and a
                      revision
                      to the production application.</p>
                    <p>Aria provides a user-interface (UI) based application that allows engineers to easily configure,
                      deploy, review status of, and destroy the above described resources within their production or
                      staging environment of choice. As of the first iteration of the tool, Aria inserts the canary
                      analysis infrastructure to Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS).
                      More
                      specifically, Aria inserts infrastructure such that network traffic is routed by an existing
                      application load balancer (ALB) to be served by the Aria defined canary instances.</p>

                    <ul class="alt">
                      <li>
                        <p>When comparing Aria with other alternatives like existing 3rd-party solutions and platform
                          services, Aria stands out in multiple ways.</p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <div style="display: flex;">
                          <p>First, Aria shines by <strong>self-provisioning</strong> all the necessary resources needed
                            to
                            achieve advanced
                            statistical analysis utilizing Kayenta. Furthermore, Aria deploys monitoring services
                            Prometheus
                            and
                            Grafana, allowing users a clear view into the current state of the deployment.</p>
                          <img style="width: 45%" src="./images/aria_visuals/pngs/Analysis Tools.png" />
                        </div>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p>Second, Aria was built with <strong>accessibility</strong> in mind. As opposed to other
                          canary
                          deployment tools
                          that have an overwhelming amount of configuration and unclear documentation, Aria displays a
                          simple
                          single page UI that facilitates deployment creation and configuration. The UI focuses on
                          meaningful configuration analysis and select targeting of a subset of the user-base per
                          deployment. </p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p>Third, Aria is <strong>open-source</strong>. Companies that want to experiment with canary
                          deployments may not want to invest in third-party solutions which can be quite costly or
                          cannot
                          be customized.</p>
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Taking all these together, Aria, being easy to use, free, and abstracting much of the
                      complexity
                      that comes with a canary deployment, is a perfect fit for a small company like ChartHealth that
                      wants to get its feet wet with canary deployments and advanced canary analysis. Being able to
                      create
                      and destroy all of the resources necessary to deploy a canary with just a few clicks allows
                      developers to explore canary deployment and analysis without having to invest too much effort
                      and
                      time.</p>

                    <h3 id="four.three">4.3 Why Choose Aria?</h3>
                    <p>Deploying infrastructure and configuration in support of advanced statistical analysis of canary
                      deployments is both tedious and complex. To implement this approach, developers must be concerned
                      with traffic splitting rules; how to configure the traffic weights, and how to set up traffic
                      monitoring and analysis. In addition to configuration, engineering teams must also provision the
                      infrastructure associated with the deployment and setup observability tools in concert with that
                      infrastructure. With Aria, infrastructure creation and tedious configuration is automated and
                      abstracted behind an intuitive UI. Furthermore, if any issues arise with the canary instance,
                      traffic can be easily removed from the canary, rolling back to the previous pre-canary stable
                      environment. With these tasks addressed by Aria, developers are more willing to try canary
                      deployments and can benefit from its data analysis features.</p>
                    <p>Aria was built specifically to lower the barrier for developers that want to try canary
                      deployments
                      and analysis tools. It is simple to configure the canary settings and to use Aria’s
                      straightforward
                      UI in order to meaningfully configure and manage canary deployment infrastructure. Rolling back is
                      easy if the new service revision is performing poorly -- with just a click of a button.</p>

                    <p>Aria use can be broken down into three main UI interactions which correspond to the lifecycle of
                      an
                      Aria canary deployment. First, a user configures the infrastructure to be deployed to the
                      accessible
                      environment (VPC) of their choice. Once the application has been deployed, the user has the
                      ability
                      to view the status and health of individual Aria deployments. Lastly, with one click, the user can
                      tear down the Aria canary deployment such that the initial state of the environment is restored.
                    </p>
                    <h4 id="four.four.one">4.4.1 Local Environment Setup</h4>
                    <p>In order to interface with AWS services, Aria requires that the user’s local development
                      environment include the AWS CDK Toolkit, AWS CLI, and their AWS account credentials. Aria is
                      launched by invoking <code>npm start</code> terminal command which subsequently launches the UI

                      Upon launching the Aria UI, the user is prompted to select one of the locally defined AWS
                      profiles.
                      Aria automatically fetches all relevant AWS resource data, Aria deployments, and status
                      information
                      accessible by the selected AWS profile.</p>

                    <p>Along with giving the canary a title and description. The user is
                      presented with a Aria deployment
                      creation form. Within the form, traffic splitting can be configured by selecting a traffic weight
                      and rule priority. Optional settings, such as sticky sessions which enables re-routing of users to
                      the same target group on subsequent requests, can also be toggled on/off. The user can also
                      specify
                      under what conditions traffic will be forwarded to the new canary and baseline target groups.
                      Finally, the user provides the docker image and docker-compose files that specify how the Docker
                      containers should be run on the new instances. The canary can then be deployed with one click.

                    <p>Once deployed, the user can view the statuses of the provisioned instances along with their event
                      logs in a simple and streamlined dashboard. This information can be accessed via the ‘Status’ menu
                      item in the sidebar. The displayed table conveys the state, status, and target health of all the
                      three provisioned instances that were created for each of the Aria deployments. Each entry within
                      the status table also contains a link to view the event logs of that instance.</p>
                    <p>Within the summary of each deployment, accessible via the ’Deployment’ sidebar menu item, are
                      links
                      to the Prometheus, Grafana, Kayenta and Referee monitoring tools. These tools are automatically
                      configured and created by Aria when the canary is provisioned, and are automatically set-up to
                      monitor the canary and baseline instances. </p>

                    <p>When the user is satisfied with the canary deployment progress, the canary, baseline, and
                      monitoring instances can be torn down with one easy click of the ‘Destroy’ button. This button can
                      be accessed within the deployment specific summary. After destroying an Aria deployment, the
                      production environment is restored to its previous state wherein all incoming network traffic is
                      routed to the current production service.</p>

                <h2>6. Engineering Decisions and Tradeoffs</h2>
                <P>The development team encountered several engineering challenges while building Aria. These challenges
                  resulted in several impactful decisions which influenced the Aria capabilities and limitations.</P>
                <section id="section61">
                  <h3 id="six.one">6.1 Infrastructure-as-Code Tooling</h3>
                  <h4 id="six.one.one">6.1.1 IaC Landscape</h4>
                  <p>As mentioned above, infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tooling is utilized by Aria to manage its canary
                    analysis infrastructure. Aria specifically utilizes the AWS CDK to define its infrastructure as
                    TypeScript classes. Most IaC tooling solutions define infrastructure in a templating language format
                    like YAML or JSON. These tools are either first-party solutions offered by major cloud
                    infrastructure
                    providers (AWS, GCP, etc) or are third-party tools which utilize first-party APIs to manage
                    infrastructure (Terraform, Pulumi, etc). When researching tools the Aria development team focused on
                    the popular products: AWS CDK, Terraform, and Pulumi.</p>
                  <p>The choice of IaC tooling was significant for Aria because a majority of the Aria server code-base
                    is
                    dedicated to interfacing with, addressing the limitations of, or leveraging the benefits of the
                    selected IaC tool.</p>
                  <h4 id="six.one.two">6.1.2 Aria IaC Tooling Selection</h4>
                  <p>One of Aria’s initial design goals was to focus on AWS support because AWS is the leading
                    infrastructure service provider at ~30% market share (Canalys). In light of this design goal, the
                    Aria
                    team initially gravitated towards CDK adoption because CDK is natively supported by AWS. After
                    further
                    investigation, the team found that the biggest benefit of the platform native support is that AWS
                    utilizes the CFN service to manage deployed resources. The CFN implements its own persistent
                    database
                    for managing groups of deployed resources (i.e. stacks). This is a major benefit that freed Aria
                    from
                    the need of a database to store its own deployment meta-information. While Pulumi does support a
                    variety of programming languages, neither Pulumi nor Terraform provide an AWS CFN interface. Another
                    major benefit unique to CDK is that the tool allows for programmatic definition of resource stacks.
                    This allows CDK resource definitions to utilize software mechanisms (loops, if/else statements,
                    etc),
                    to be testable, and leverage software versioning techniques.</p>
                  <p>However, selection of AWS CDK as the IaC tooling of choice wasn’t automatic. Compared to Pulumi and
                    Terraform, a major downside of the AWS CDK is its lack of multi-platform support. Both Terraform and
                    Pulumi support deploying to multiple cloud providers using a single infrastructure definition
                    template. This benefit would have theoretically allowed future iterations of Aria to add support for
                    additional cloud providers such as GCP and Azure without modifying the Aria resource definition
                    template. But these providers do offer the Azure Resource Manager and Google Cloud Deployment
                    Manager
                    products that allow for groups of resources to be managed in a manner similar to AWS CFN stacks.
                    Preferring to leverage resource grouping services, the Aria team accepted the additional complexity
                    of
                    implementing native tooling for each provider individually in favor of utilizing a single provider
                    agnostic tool.</p>
                  <p>Another major downside is that the AWS CDK is relatively immature. The CDK is the most recently
                    introduced of all the tooling solutions considered, where Terraform is the oldest (introduced 2014).
                    A
                    brief review of the AWS forums revealed CDK has many outstanding open issues. The expectation was
                    that
                    Terraform would be a much more stable tool due to its longevity and popularity. Although, based on
                    the
                    high level of AWS CDK community adoption, it was the Aria team’s expectation that AWS will continue
                    to
                    support the CDK. It was also acknowledged that development time would likely be longer than if Aria
                    leveraged Terraform due to open issues or poor documentation. While the team was able to
                    successfully
                    develop Aria using the AWS CDK, the development of that tooling did indeed last longer than
                    initially
                    anticipated due to CDK limitations.</p>
                  <p></p>
                  <h4 id="six.one.three">6.1.3 Addressing CDK Limitations</h4>
                  <p>AWS CDK provides little support for interfacing with and configuring existing infrastructure. While
                    the CDK does implement classes which can represent existing resources, those resources are meant to
                    be
                    defined within a local stack template file. This aspect of the CDK was troublesome for the team
                    because Aria requires interfacing with resources defined outside the CDK such as; private networks,
                    load balancers, instances, routing rules, etc.</p>
                  <p>In order to address this CDK shortcoming, the Aria team developed a library of functions
                    incorporating the AWS Software Development Kit (SDK). These functions focus on fetching and
                    formatting
                    the existing resource information such that the CDK can deploy to existing private networks and
                    route
                    traffic to newly added Aria infrastructure. </p>
                  <p>Another limitation of the CDK is that individual CFN stacks are meant to be exclusive to a single
                    class declaration (i.e. local template file). While this one-to-one relationship is supported by the
                    CDK CLI commands, programmatic reuse of the class declaration isn’t supported out-of-the-box.
                    Bypassing the CDK CLI, Aria implements a parent “wrapper” class which exposes CDK core library
                    methods
                    and defines additional supplemental methods. This wrapper class allows for the class defining the
                    Aria
                    stack to be reused without invoking the CLI commands either as a child process or via the terminal.
                    These additional methods allow the CDK to escape the one-to-one template to stack relationship by
                    re-synthesizing the local template file for each stack deployment and destruction on an as-needed
                    basis. In other words, Aria overcomes the CDK restraints by defining a group of resources within a
                    class which can be reused for each Aria deployment.</p>
